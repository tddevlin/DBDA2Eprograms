# Exercise 9.1

The following plots were produced by running `Exercise-09-01.R`.

## (A)

For a gamma distribution with mean 1.0 and s.d. 10.0, the shape and rate parameters are *s* = *r* = 0.1.

For a gamma distribution with **mode** 1.0 and s.d. 10.0, the shape parameter is *s* = 1.105 and the rate parameter is *r* = 0.105.


## (B)

This plot shows three different views of two gamma distributions, one with a mode of 1 and the other with a mean of 1.

The gamma distribution with a mode of 1 (in black) favors values of 洧랜 betwen about 0.1 and 75, whereas the gamma distribution with a mean of 1 (in blue) favors values of 洧랜 that are either very small or very large.

## (C)

Here are the posterior distributions for the gamma distribution with mode 1.

![post_mode_theta](Exercise-09-01C-mode-PostTheta.png)

Here are the posterior distributions for the gamma distribution with mean 1.

## (D)

The marginal posterior distribution on 洧랜 has a much longer right-tail for the gamma prior with mean 1 rather than mode 1. When the concentration parameter 洧랜 is larger, the effect of shrinkage on the 洧랚 parameters is correspondingly greater. This is readily visible in the marginal posterior plots of theta[1] and theta[28] above.

## (E)

I think the gamma prior with mean 1 is more appropriate, because it allows for a wider range of credible values on 洧랜.
